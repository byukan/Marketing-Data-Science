    "## What is  A/B Testing?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) is a term for a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and variation in the controlled experiment. A/B testing is a form of statistical hypothesis testing with two variants leading to the technical term, two-sample hypothesis testing, used in the field of statistics. Other terms used for this method include bucket tests and split-run testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the online world, the goal of A/B testing is to determine whether or not the users will like a particular new product / feature.  "
